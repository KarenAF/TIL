7/18/17 Markdown syntax code blocks

there are two ways to write code in an md document: one back tick or three back ticks. 
i.e.: 


\`\`\` this is code with three back ticks \`\`\`
becomes
``` this is code with three back ticks ```

\` this is code with one back tick \`
becomes
`this is code with one back tick `
