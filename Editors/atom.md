7/29/17 Adding Packages to Atom 
<br> 
My search for a way to convert my markdown files to pdf in order to upload them to my personal website, karenaf.github.io, led me to read about an Atom package called Markdown-pdf, made by github user Travs. 

I wasn't actually sure how to install Markdown-pdf, since his github repo at https://github.com/travs/markdown-pdf only talks about how to _use_ mark-down pdf. But I did install Atom, and after tinkering around, I finally discovered the trick. Here are the simple instructions to use this and any nifty Atom package: 

**Open Atom. Go to the menu bar at the top where it says File, Edit, View, Selection, Find, Packages, Window, Help. Click File > Preferences > Install > Install Packages > search for markdown-pdf. Then click install.**

And voila. 

After it's done installing, it will automatically show up in the list of Packages you currently you have installed. See Packages > Markdown-Pdf in the top menu bar. From there, you can click "convert," which converts whatever markdown page you have open and focused on in the Markdown preview. (Make sure you have Markdown preview on.) (Packages > Markdown Preview > "Toggle Preview: ctrl + shift + M")
